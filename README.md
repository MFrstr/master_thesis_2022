## Abstract
In the early 2000s, the basic idea of making and manufacturing with high-tech industrial machines for private purposes rose to the origin of Fabrication Laboratories, shorted Fab Labs. Thus, a Fab Lab owns many of devices like 3D printers or laser cutters. With building and running such a workshop that is open to society, the question how to manage a Fab Lab arises. Based on a design case study within the Fab Lab Siegen, essential functionalities for a management tool in the form of an online platform are explored and analyzed. This thesis reports the development of a high-fidelity prototype for a management platform as web application. In advance of prototyping, qualitative interviews with Fab Lab Siegen staff were conducted to determine the social practices of staff members during their work in the Fab Lab. Within the scope of this thesis, knowing about and understanding social practices is the basis for developing a prototype because the application intends to support and facilitate everyday work and procedures of staff and guests of the Fab Lab Siegen. Under the guidance of the human-centered design theory and usability heuristics (after Jakob Nielsen), the prototype’s interface design should guarantee good usability and user satisfaction. Fab Lab Siegen staff will test the finalized prototype on functionality and interface design. Results show that such a platform, in its basic form, is mainly needed to handle the access control for machines, digitize work processes, and give an overview for guests of the Lab itself. Indeed, creativity does not set boundaries for more complex functionalities. Moreover, the rate of functionality also depends on the individual case, as not every Fab Lab is built and equipped the same way. A management tool has to adapt to the prevailing conditions, social practices, and needs of the Lab to be helpful.
